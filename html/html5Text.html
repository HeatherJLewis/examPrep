    <h1>Structural Elements</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Structural elements define the organisational structure - headings and paragraphs.</p>
    <h1>An h1 Heading</h1>
    <h2>An h2 Heading</h2>
    <h3>An h3 Heading</h3>
    <h4>An h4 Heading</h4>
    <h5>An h5 Heading</h5>
    <h6>An h6 Heading</h6>
    <p>A paragraph consists of 5 - 6 sentences which form a unit of self-contained discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>
    <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into paragraphs.</p>
    <p>White space collapsing is a thing! Browsers treat mutliple white spaces as a single white space.</p>
    <p>Using line breaks<br/> may help to format your text into <br/>easily readable chunks.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Horizontal rules help to organise things further!</p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Strong</h2>
    <p><strong>Strong</strong> is used to show emphasis and importance. Shown by default as bold.</p>
    <p><em>em</em> is used to show emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of the sentence. Shown by default in italic.</p>
    <blockquote cite="bbc.co.uk">
        <p>A lovely little quote in a block quote. Browsers tend to indent this but you shouldn't use this just to indent text - use CSS instead. Can add a link as a citation in the tag as an attribute.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A quote tag adds quotation marks and can be used within a p tag. As a wise person said,
        <q>stay happy!</q>
    </p>
    <p>An abbr tag enables you to specify the full term if you use an abbreviation or acronym. For example:
        <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Jane Mellor.
        But what is the point of this? Does it help screen readers?
    </p>
    <p>You can create a citation:
        <cite>A Brief History of Time</cite>
        by Stephen Hawking sold a lot of books!
    </p>
    <p>
        A definition can also be created thus: A
            <dfn>black hole</dfn> is a very dense region of space. <br/>
        This is used to explain new terminology in the first instance of it (the defining instance). Some browsers show this in italics but some do not.
    </p>
    <p>You can make things <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <s>strikethrough</s>, <small>small</small> <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup>.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Bold</b> can also stylistically offset text in html5?
    </p>
    <p>You can also <del>delete</del> <ins>insert</ins> things.</p>
    <p>Special characters &copy</p>
    <address>Not sure quite what the address tag does. It seems to make things italic but then lots of other things do this too!</address>
